This is a very simple blog built with Django, Django REST Framework, React/Redux, and Bootstrap. It can be useful as an example of integrating Django with React, or as a starter project.

It has an auth system, and it allows you to create and edit blog posts.

I have built this project by following [these](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)  [two](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux-tutorial/) awesome React courses, I highly recommend them to anybody who wants to learn React! And [this](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/django-rest-framework)  Django REST Framework course really helped me to build the backend.
<!-- and this one helped me to dockerize the thing -->

You can check out the demo [here](). You can [login]() with username "admin" and password "1234" to try creating and editing posts(please be nice, don't post anything that might offend anybody).
